TinySearch
==========

This is an (intelligent) search engine implementation in Perl. It searches a particular domain (http://www.unt.edu) for relevant pages and serves to demonstrate key concepts in information retrieval and web search. It consists of a crawler, indexer and graphical user interface. A demo can be found at http://students.cse.unt.edu/~dta0022/searchengine/ A PDF document explaining how the search engine works can be found at http://students.cse.unt.edu/~dta0022/searchengine/report.pdf
